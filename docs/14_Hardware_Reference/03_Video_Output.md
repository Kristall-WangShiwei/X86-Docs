### Video Output Connectors

The IntelÂ® Braswell family of SoCs offer three Digital Display Interfaces, configurable to work in HDMI/DVI/DP++ modes.  

#### HDMI Connector

On the UDOO x86 board, the Digital Display Interface #0 is used to implement a HDMI interface.

HDMI featured by the Intel&reg; Braswell processor is the version v1.4.  
It can manage a resolution up to 4k 30fps 8bit.  
The 1080p resolution is managed in 60fps.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span>  Always use HDMI-certified cables for the connection between the board and the HDMI display; a category 2 (High-Speed) cable is recommended for higher resolutions, category 1 cables can be used for 720p resolution.

You can use this [HDMI to HDMI](http://shop.udoo.org/cable-hdmi-to-hdmi.html) cable to connect your display.

#### MiniDisplay Port ++ Connectors

On the UDOO x86 board, the Digital Display Interfaces #1 and #2 are used to implement a multimode Display Port (DP++)interface, i.e. it can be used to support DP displays directly and, through an external adapter, also HDMI or DVI displays.

The configuration of this interface in DP or HDMI/DVI mode is automatic.

HDMI featured by the Intel&reg; Braswell processor is the version v1.4.  
It can manage a resolution up to 4k 30fps 8bit.  
The 1080p resolution is managed in 60fps.

You can use these [MiniDP++ to DP](http://shop.udoo.org/cable-minidp-to-dp.html) and [MiniDP++ to HDMI](http://shop.udoo.org/cable-minidp-to-hdmi.html) cables to connect your displays.
